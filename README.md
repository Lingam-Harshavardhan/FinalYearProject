# FinalYearProject

This project looks at the big worry about deepfake tech, which makes really believable but completely fake videos. It talks about how deepfakes spread lies, change how people think, invade privacy, mess with elections, create security problems, and make people doubt what they see online. It's really important to find these fake videos to stop lies and keep trust in what we see on the internet.
The future of deepfake detection depends on using large datasets for training, including audio analysis, and creating clearer models. These improvements are key to keeping trust online.
